      <p> The Mirror
Unloving to Love
But No, I love somebody else
I need your help unloving her,
Because she doesn\rquote t treat me right.
You treat me right, You love me.
I want to be with you,
But I am in a hole, I loved her into.
She has no sense of loyalty, treats everybody the same way I am treated.
I can\rquote t say she loves me, but I find comfort in her arms.
I love you and you comfort me.
You love me and me loving you is enough for you.
I want to give my all to you and more than you never knew I had.
All of the things I want to say, but I can only think it for now
I am loving an Angel and I want to unlove a demon.
---- I am only human.----
